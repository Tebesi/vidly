It is really important that we learn how to find the value of X

Given an equation to find the value of X as shown below,how do we go about it?

X + 3 =7
In order to find the value of X,it must remain alone(INDEPENDENT) on the left hand side of the equals sign.
However this we must do using mathematics principles by elminating 3 by subtracting it from both sides.

X + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3

X = 4 ;
